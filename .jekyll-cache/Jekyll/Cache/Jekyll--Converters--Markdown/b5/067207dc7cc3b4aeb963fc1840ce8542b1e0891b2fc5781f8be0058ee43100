I"è<p>Rails framework and twitter bootstrap are good for your startup project, build-in generators generate source code by its way. It is  a good starting point.</p>

<p>But I often have to change default generted source code:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add <strong>encoding: utf-8</strong> into ruby file header, for Ruby 1.9.2 encoding.</li>
  <li>Change scaffold view files to apply <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">bootstrap</a> css.</li>
  <li>Other things you want to override default templates.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rails provides the mechanism to custom generator behavior.</p>

<p>I have already got it, and source code is on <a href="https://github.com/qichunren/rails_generator_override_templates">github</a>, follow README for usage.</p>
